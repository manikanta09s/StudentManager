Error Handling: Your current code doesn't handle potential issues like a user entering a string when an integer is expected (e.g., for ID or marks). This could cause the program to crash with an InputMismatchException. You could add a try-catch block around the user input to handle these situations gracefully.

Data Validation: You could add checks to ensure that the user enters valid data, such as a positive ID or marks within a reasonable range (e.g., 0-100). This would make your program more robust.

Code Reusability: In your updateStudent and deleteStudent methods, you're iterating through the list to find a student by their ID. You could create a separate helper method, findStudentById(int id), that returns the Student object or null if not found. This would make your code more modular and prevent you from writing the same search logic multiple times.

Overall, this is a solid example of a simple but effective Java application. Your code is easy to read, and it demonstrates a good understanding of fundamental programming concepts.
